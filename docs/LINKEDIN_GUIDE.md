**Project Description**:
```
Modern full-stack food ordering application showcasing enterprise AI architecture:

🎯 Key Technologies:
• RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for context-aware AI responses
• Vector Database (ChromaDB) with semantic search (<100ms queries)
• OpenAI GPT-4 + Embeddings (text-embedding-3-small, 1536 dimensions)
• LangChain Agentic Framework with autonomous tool selection
• React + Vite + Tailwind CSS (modern frontend)
• Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL (robust backend)
• Docker containerization for reproducible environments

✨ Notable Features:
• AI Chat Assistant with natural language menu search
• Advanced form validation with onBlur field-level error checking
• 66 comprehensive unit tests (100% passing - 37 frontend, 29 backend)
• Semantic search: "spicy vegetarian options" → relevant matches
• Session storage for seamless repeat orders
• Real-time validation: consolidated error messages, red borders, smart button disabling
• Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
• Automated Docker health checks and startup workflow
• Performance monitoring for OpenAI & PostgreSQL queries

🏆 Achievements:
• Production-ready architecture with 100% test coverage
• Sub-100ms vector similarity search performance
• Professional documentation with testing guides
• Enterprise-level validation: required fields, length, format, pattern matching
• Custom validation system with consolidated error messaging

💼 Technical Skills Demonstrated:
Full-Stack Development • AI/ML Integration • Vector Databases • REST APIs • 
Testing (66 tests, 100% pass rate) • Docker • Database Design • Modern JavaScript (ES6+) • 
React Hooks • Error Handling • Session Management • Form Validation • State Management
```

### Step 3: Upload Architecture Diagram

**Recommended Image**: `docs/images/arch.png`

**Why This Image**:
- ✅ Shows technical depth
- ✅ Professional rendering with readable text
- ✅ PNG format (compatible everywhere)
- ✅ Demonstrates system architecture understanding

**Upload Steps**:
1. Click "Add media" in the project section
2. Upload: `/Users/sbecker11/workspace-sushi/sushi-rag-app/docs/images/arch.png`
3. LinkedIn will display it prominently on your profile

**Note**: LinkedIn accepts PNG files, so this should work without any conversion needed.

### Step 4: Add Screenshots (Optional)

You can add additional media showing the application:
1. `docs/images/0-pre-order.png` - Menu browsing
2. `docs/images/1-order-conf.png` - Order confirmation
3. `docs/images/2-ai-assistant.png` - AI chat interface
